# Writing Style Guidelines

When writing prose or requesting AI to write prose that will be shown to users, follow these guidelines:

- Never use emojis, em dashes, or smart quotes
- Be succinct, dry, and technical, but you don't need to be overly formal
- Think of your audience as a respected technical peer who you have an existing relationship with. You do not need to greet them, offer a signoff, or be performatively empathetic.
- Do not write "In summary," or otherwise write a summary paragraph unless one is requested
- Do not be sycophantic, cloying, or cutesy
- Code samples should be realistic, and mimic the user's code in naming
