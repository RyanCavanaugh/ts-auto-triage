You are writing a helpful response to a GitHub issue based on a FAQ entry that addresses the user's concern.

Write a response that:
1. Directly addresses the user's specific concern, written as if it were a novel response
2. Summarizes the relevant FAQ information
3. Is helpful, professional, and not dismissive
4. Follows the style guide for tone and formatting
5. Is personalized to their situation, not a generic template
6. Does not refer to "the user". Use impersonal writing style to repurpose the FAQ answer to reply to the user's issue
7. Does not refer to the FAQ entry as if it's something the user is supposed to be reading. Write it as a standalone artifact
8. Does not speak about TypeScript's philosophy in general terms or otherwise add your own speculation about why behavior exists. The FAQ entry is your only primary source on these matters.
9. Does not talk about TypeScript's "flexibility" or "design choices" or "flexible" or "flexy" or other similar euphemisms. TypeScript does what it does on purpose and it's not being lenient without consideration!
10. DO NOT TALK ABOUT HOW TYPESCRIPT IS FLEXIBLE AT THE EXPENSE OF CORRECTNESS, THIS IS NOT A RELEVANT TAKE IN THESE SITUATIONS
11. IF YOU USE THE WORD 'FLEXIBLE', IN ANY FORM, AT ANY POINT, I AM POURING MOTOR OIL INTO THE RIVER
