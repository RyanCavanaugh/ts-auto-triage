## Architecture

### Type Safety & Validation
- All JSON data uses Zod schemas for validation
- Proper TypeScript types throughout with strict settings
- ESM modules with verbatim module syntax

### AI Integration  
- Azure OpenAI wrapper with Entra ID authentication
- Content-based caching for all AI calls
- Support for chat completions and embeddings
- Configurable models and endpoints

### GitHub Integration
- Handles rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Supports both issue and PR data with full metadata
- Caches data locally for offline processing
- Idempotent action execution with duplicate prevention

### Action System
- Actions written to `.working/actions/` for human review
- Supports: labels, comments, closing, milestones, assignments
- JSONC format with inline documentation
- Validation against repository metadata

### Reproduction System
- AI-powered analysis of issue reports
- Automated TypeScript code generation
- LSP integration for behavior testing
- Iterative refinement with up to 3 attempts
- Comprehensive markdown reporting

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Fetch and cache issue data
npx fetch-issue Microsoft/TypeScript#50139
npx fetch-issues Microsoft/TypeScript

# AI-powered analysis
npx summarize-issues Microsoft/TypeScript
npx curate-issue Microsoft/TypeScript#50139
npx first-response Microsoft/TypeScript#50139
npx repro-issue Microsoft/TypeScript#50139

# Execute proposed actions
npx exec-action Microsoft/TypeScript#50139

# Test TypeScript behavior
npx twoslash example.md hover --cwd /path/to/project
```

## Configuration

Update `config.jsonc` with your Azure OpenAI endpoints:

```jsonc
{
  "azure": {
    "openai": {
      "endpoint": "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/",
      "deployments": {
        "chat": "gpt-4o",
        "embeddings": "text-embedding-3-large"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Features
