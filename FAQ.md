# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is my issue being automatically triaged?

> Q: I just opened an issue and received an automated response. Is anyone actually reading my issue?

All issues are reviewed by maintainers. The automated triage helps us organize issues more efficiently so we can focus on addressing your concerns rather than categorizing them. Your issue will be reviewed by a human maintainer.

### How do I report a bug that isn't a duplicate?

> Q: The bot says my issue is a duplicate but I think it's different. What should I do?

Please review the linked duplicate issue carefully. If you believe your issue describes a different problem, add a comment explaining the key differences. A maintainer will review and reopen if needed.
