# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why isn't my issue being processed?

> Q: I submitted an issue yesterday but haven't seen any automated response. Is the system working?

The automated triage system processes issues in batches. New issues are typically reviewed within 24-48 hours. If your issue involves a complex reproduction case, it may take longer for the system to validate the reported behavior.

### How does the duplicate detection work?

> Q: The bot marked my issue as a duplicate, but I think it's different from the linked issue. What should I do?

The duplicate detection uses semantic similarity analysis on issue summaries. If you believe the marking is incorrect, please comment explaining the key differences between your issue and the suggested duplicate. A maintainer will review and update the classification if needed.
