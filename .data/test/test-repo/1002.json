  "body": "When I import a type from another file, IntelliSense doesn't suggest it in the completion list.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create file types.ts with export interface MyType { prop: string }\n2. In another file, type const x: My and trigger completions\n3. MyType should appear but doesn't\n\nExpected: MyType should be in the completion list\nActual: MyType is not shown\n\nThis works fine in other editors, seems to be VS Code specific.\n\nTypeScript Version: 5.3.0\nVS Code Version: 1.85.0",
